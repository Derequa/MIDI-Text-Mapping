# MIDI-Text-Mapping
A personal project for a class of mine. This program can generate MIDI files using a combination of compositional algorithms and byte mapping. Turn your data into sound! 
It is currently in beta. I have done as much functionality testing as I know how and everything works, but I am sure there are more bugs out there.
Coming soon will be more documentation, in particular, documentation for setting up custom mapping and markov schemes.
Thanks for checking this out!
If you have any ideas for expanding this project, found a bug, or think this is just cool, email me at:
